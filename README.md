A simple web-based encryption and decryption tool inspired by the Enigma Machine. Built with Python and styled using HTML/CSS, this app allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages using a Caesar cipher-style rotor shift.


Features:

Encrypt or decrypt messages using a configurable rotor shift.

User registration and login with validation

Dark and light theme toggle

File upload interface

Clean and responsive UI built with HTML and CSS.

Real-time message processing.


Working:

Users visit the homepage and can choose to either register or log in.

Login and registration data are temporarily stored in a Python dictionary within app.py

This web app uses a simplified Caesar cipher:

Each letter in the message is shifted by a specified number (rotor).

The encryption and decryption process works by adding or subtracting this rotor value.
