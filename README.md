A simple web-based encryption and decryption tool inspired by the Enigma Machine. Built with Python and styled using HTML/CSS, this app allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages using a Caesar cipher-style rotor shift.

Features:
Encrypt or decrypt messages using a configurable rotor shift.
Clean and responsive UI built with HTML and CSS.
Real-time message processing.
Working:
This web app uses a simplified Caesar cipher:
Each letter in the message is shifted by a specified number (rotor).
The encryption and decryption process works by adding or subtracting this rotor value.
